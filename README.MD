## Conway's Game of Life Rules

1. ```Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies(death of lonelyness)```

2. ```Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies (overpopulation)```

3. ```Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives and moves on to the next generation```

4. ``` Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors will come to life(reproduction).```
